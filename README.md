Trivia game:
To create a timed trivia game. Only 15 seconds were alotted to each question. After all of the questions were finished, the final scoreboard of how well you did would appear.

Motivation
I wanted to create a Star Wars trivia game that showcase the most recent Star Wars movies. For the non Star Wars believers, the answer is very easy to guess.
